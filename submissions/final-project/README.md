# Password Manager that is full of bugs and errors.

A minimalist application that is rich of bugs and error
It can perform expected operations such as registering account and log in.
The buggy behavior is that when I am trying to update the new name it prompts me the password instead of name,
the delete function is not properly configured, it throws me an error 404 sometimes.

Thoughts: Should learn more about database, modularity and other specific functions that is crucial for login management, and also should practice more on security management side of the application as a good practice. This simple application will be serve as a first step towards learning more things. My experience when developing this simple app is full of confusion, reading documentation and devastation as the program crash so it myself. This app conquers me more than I conquer it.
